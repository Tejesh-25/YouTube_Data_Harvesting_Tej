# INTRODUCTION
Hi this is Tejesh and this my first data science project : Youtube Data Harvesting. While doing this project I have extract the data from Youtube with the help of channelId,
I have get the data in the form of unstructured so I have planned to store into mongodb. After storing the data into mongodb I need to transfer unstructural form to the structural form so,I have planned to store into MYSQL and then analysing data depending on the customer questions by using streamlit apllication.
